  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Loop Do-It-Yourself automated insulin delivery system., Research Design and Methods: A prospective real-world observational study was conducted, which included 558 adults and children (age range 1–71 years, mean HbA1c 6.8\% ± 1.0\%) who initiated Loop either on their own or with community-developed resources and provided data for 6 months., Results: Mean time-in-range 70–180 mg/dL (TIR) increased from 67\% ± 16\% at baseline (before starting Loop) to 73\% ± 13\% during the 6 months (mean change from baseline 6.6\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.9\%–7.4\%; P {\textless} 0.001). TIR increased in both adults and children, across the full range of baseline HbA1c, and in participants with both high- and moderate-income levels. Median time {\textless}54 mg/dL was 0.40\% at baseline and changed by −0.05\% (95\% CI −0.09\% to −0.03\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Mean HbA1c was 6.8\% ± 1.0\% at baseline and decreased to 6.5\% ± 0.8\% after 6 months (mean difference = −0.33\%, 95\% CI −0.40\% to −0.26\%, P {\textless} 0.001). The incidence rate of reported severe hypoglycemia events was 18.7 per 100 person-years, a reduction from the incidence rate of 181 per 100 person-years during the 3 months before the study. Among the 481 users providing Loop data at 6 months, median continuous glucose monitoring use was 96\% (interquartile range [IQR] 91\%–98\%) and median time Loop modulating basal insulin was at least 83\% (IQR 73\%–88\%)., Conclusions: The Loop open source system can be initiated with community-developed resources and used safely and effectively by adults and children with type 1 diabetes.},

Patients were stratified by age, sex, migration background, and country.Among 96,547 patients with type 1 diabetes (median age 17.9 years, 53\% males), the percentage using insulin pump therapy increased from 1\% in 1995 to 53\% in 2017, with the highest rates in the youngest patients (92\% in preschoolers, 74\% in children, 56\% in adolescents aged \&lt;15 years, 46\% in adolescents aged ≥15 years, 37\% in adults). The percentage of patients using CGM increased from 3\% in 2006 to 38\% in 2017, with the highest rates in the youngest patients (58\%, 52\%, 45\%, 33\%, and 15\% of respective age-groups). Daily SMBG frequencies increased from 1995 to 2016 and decreased afterward, most prominently in the youngest patients. Between 2015 and 2017, pump therapy was more frequently used in female versus male adolescents and adults (all P \&lt; 0.001), while no sex differences were observed for pump use in children \&lt;10 years (all P = 1.0) and for CGM use in all age-groups (all P = 1.0).Since 1995, insulin pump use has continuously increased, and insulin pump therapy is now standard in patients aged \&lt;15 years. CGM use sharply rose in recent years, particularly in young children.},

Early community-wide adoption of open-source AID, such as OpenAPS, has motivated clinical and research communities to understand and evaluate glucose-related outcomes of such user-driven innovation. Initial OpenAPS studies include retrospective studies assessing high-level outcomes of average glucose levels and HbA1c, without in-depth analysis of glucose variability (GV). The OpenAPS Data Commons dataset, donated to by open-source AID users with insulinrequiring diabetes, is the largest freely available diabetes-related dataset with over 46,070 days’ worth of data and over 10 million CGM data points, alongside insulin dosing and algorithmic decision data. This paper first reviews the development toward the latest open-source AID and the performance of clinically approved GV metrics. We evaluate the GV outcomes using large-scale data analytics for the n = 122 version of the OpenAPS Data Commons. We describe the data cleaning processes, methods for measuring GV, and the results of data analysis based on individual self-reported demographics. Furthermore, we highlight the lessons learned from the GV outcomes and the analysis of a rich and complex diabetes dataset and additional research questions that emerged from this work to guide future research. This paper affirms previous studies’ findings of the efficacy of open-source AID. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which a deficiency in insulin production impairs the glucose homeostasis of the body. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin is a commonly used treatment method. Artificial pancreas systems (APS) use continuous glucose level monitoring and continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin in a closed-loop mode incorporating a controller (or control algorithm). However, the operation of APS is challenging because of complexities arising during meals, exercise, stress, sleep, illnesses, glucose sensing and insulin action delays, and the cognitive burden. To overcome these challenges, options to augment APS through integration of additional inputs, creating multi-input APS (MAPS), are being investigated.

Objective
The aim of this survey is to identify and analyze input data, control architectures, and validation methods of MAPS to better understand the complexities and current state of such systems. This is expected to be valuable in developing improved systems to enhance the quality of life of people with T1D.

Methods
A literature survey was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases for the period January 1, 2005, to February 10, 2020. On the basis of the search criteria, 1092 articles were initially shortlisted, of which 11 (1.01\%) were selected for an in-depth narrative analysis. In addition, 6 clinical studies associated with the selected studies were also analyzed.

Results
Signals such as heart rate, accelerometer readings, energy expenditure, and galvanic skin response captured by wearable devices were the most frequently used additional inputs. The use of invasive (blood or other body fluid analytes) inputs such as lactate and adrenaline were also simulated. These inputs were incorporated to switch the mode of the controller through activity detection, directly incorporated for decision-making and for the development of intermediate modules for the controller. The validation of the MAPS was carried out through the use of simulators based on different physiological models and clinical trials.

Conclusions
The integration of additional physiological signals with continuous glucose level monitoring has the potential to optimize glucose control in people with T1D through addressing the identified limitations of APS. Most of the identified additional inputs are related to wearable devices. The rapid growth in wearable technologies can be seen as a key motivator regarding MAPS. However, it is important to further evaluate the practical complexities and psychosocial aspects associated with such systems in real life.},
